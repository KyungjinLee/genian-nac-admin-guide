Configuring Default Settings
============================

Default Settings are configured for both Network Appliances and Sensors, 
this allows configurations to be cloned onto other Network Appliances and Sensors 
when added onto the network. This eliminates the need for the Administrator to 
configure each one. As a Remote Site is added and a Network Sensor is installed 
it will inherit the configurations from the Network Appliance settings. 
If Additional VLANs are configured then these VLANs will inherit configurations from the Sensor settings.
