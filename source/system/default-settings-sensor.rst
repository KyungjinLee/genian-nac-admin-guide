Configuring Sensor Settings
===========================

You can configure Default Settings for all sensors that will be added to the Policy Server. These settings are optional and can later be changed on individual Sensors if you want to have unique settings for each

To Configure Sensor Settings
----------------------------

#. Go to System in the top panel
#. Go to System > System Defaults > Network Sensor in the left System Management panel  
   - Sensor Mode: Host
     - If Sensor Mode is set to None, this disables the Sensor
     - *If you have more than one VLAN, you will need to set Host Mode for all VLAN networks on each Sensor to be scanned.
