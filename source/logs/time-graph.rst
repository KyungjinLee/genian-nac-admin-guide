Time Graph and Chart
====================

Time Graph
----------

The Time Graph shows you the amount of log activity per day in a seven-day increment. You can use the Left and Right
Arrows in the upper left of the image above to scroll back in time per week to show past logs. If you want to disable 
the Time Graph from being seen you can simply uncheck the **Time Graph check box**. By default, Genians shows the Time Graph 
in a **Stacked** format meaning that all Log Types that are received for that time are sorted and stacked onto one another 
graphically.  You can choose to see these same logs in a Logarithmic view by clicking on the **Stacked drop down** and select 
**Logarithmic**

Chart

The Chart function allows you to see popular Log data for that seven-day period
