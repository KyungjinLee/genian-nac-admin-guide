Time Graph and Chart
====================

Time Graph
----------

The Time Graph shows you the amount of log activity per day. You can use the Left and Right 
Arrows in the upper left to scroll back in time per week to show past logs. 
By default, Genians shows the Time Graph in a **Stacked** format meaning that all Log Types that are received 
for that time are sorted and stacked onto one another graphically.  You can choose to see these same logs in 
a Logarithmic view by clicking on the **Stacked drop down** and select **Logarithmic**

.. note:: If you want to disable the Time Graph from being seen you can simply uncheck the **Time Graph check box**

Chart
-----

The Chart function allows you to see popular Log data for that seven-day period. These include **Top 10 IPS, MACs, Devices,** and more
