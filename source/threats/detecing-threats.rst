Detecting Anomalies
================
 
Once the configured Anomaly Definition setting is assigned to the Node Policy you would like to apply, an anomaly will be almost immediately detected either by a Network Sensor or by an Agent. 
You may see the results in a variety of ways. 

   - Find Anomaly column in Node Management
   - Edit Node View for Anomaly View
   - Trace Anomaly Log
   - Glance Dashabord Widget for Anomaly tab
   - Filter Status & Filters

Furthermore, you can be notified about an abnormal event detected. (*You may refer to the following)
