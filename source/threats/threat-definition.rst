Creating Threat Definition
==========================
 
The Threat you defined is here used when detecting a threat with a Node Policy.
This is a definition setting, therefore, you must assign the configured definition to the Node Policy you would like to apply. 

By default, there are seven pre-defined **Threat Definitions** that are frequently used. With the steps provided below, you can create your own threat definitions.
