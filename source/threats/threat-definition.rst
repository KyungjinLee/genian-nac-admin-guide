Creating Anomaly Definition
==========================
 
The Anomaly you defined is here used when detecting an anomaly with a Node Policy.
This is a definition setting, therefore, you must assign the configured definition to the Node Policy you would like to apply. 

By default, there are seven pre-defined **Anomaly Definitions** that are frequently used. With the steps provided below, you can create your own anomaly definitions.

#. Go to **Policy** in the top panel

#. Click **Tasks > Create**
#. Find **General** section. Enter criteria
#. Find **Anomaly Definitions** Settings section. Enter criteria
