Configuring Network Sensor
==========================

Network Sensor by default is configured to listen to traffic on the network and passively collects information which is passed to the Policy Server. The information that is collected assists you in identifying the endpoints IP, MAC, Platform, Hostname, and activity that allows you to build policies based on your requirements. Network Sensor Operation Mode needs to be changed from Passive to Active which allows the Policy Server to enforce policies and control endpoints access onto the network.
