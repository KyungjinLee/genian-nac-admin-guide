Cloud-Managed
=============

**Policy Server** can be deployed in the Cloud, while **Network Sensors** can be deployed by connecting them to an Edge Switch at your Remote Site locations.  The Edge Switch ports can be a standard connection or can be trunked ports for up to 128 VLANs. If your location has more then 128 VLANs then a second **Network Sensor** would be required
