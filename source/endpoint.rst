Controlling Endpoints
---------------------

An Endpoint device is an Internet-capable computer hardware device on a TCP/IP network. This can be anything from desktop computers, laptops, smartphones, tablets, thin clients, printers or other specialized hardware.

You can control Windows and macOS endpoint devices with the Genian NAC Policy Server which uses plugins to take action on the device configurations. By default, Genian NAC uses **39 Plugins**.

- **Windows (33)**
- **macOS (6)**
