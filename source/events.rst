Managing Logs and Events
------------------------

Policy Server provides a centralized Log View.
Policy Server collects system and security related events to generate logs from endpoint devices, network devices, and other third-party devices.

Log view consists of four main sections.

- Panel A: Predefined Logs that are categorized by severity, frequently used, and RADIUS.
- Window B: Time Graph and Chart.
- Panel C: Status and Filter.
- Window D: Result window of your searching and filtering.
