Configuring Captive Web Portal
==============================

A **Captive Web Portal** (**CWP**) is a ‘landing’ web page, often used to present a landing or log-in page. The portal intercepts observed packets until such time as the user is authorized to launch browser sessions. The user is granted conditional Internet or Network access once Authentication, EULA Agreement, Payment, or other valid credentials have been agreed upon

Types of Captive Web Portals
----------------------------

There are 3 types of Captive Web Portals:

- **Default CWP Page**: Displays a user login page with messaging
- **Security Policy Page**: Displays a user login page with messaging
- **Custom URL**: Displays a customized company page for user authentication
